    <h2>Block Element</h2>
    <!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). -->
    <div>
        <p>
            This the first paragraph. The background color of these paragraphs have been
            colored to distinguish them from their parent element.
        </p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Inline Element</h2>
    <!-- An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. -->
    <span>Hello World</span>
